- **Google Gemini API Key** (free from Google AI Studio)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Or with yarn
yarn install
```

### 2. Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the generated API key

```

### Key Components and Functions

#### Main State Management

## API Integration

The application uses Google's Gemini Pro model with optimized prompting:

```typescript
const prompt = `Please provide a comprehensive and accurate answer to the following question: ${question}

Please make sure your answer is:
- Clear and well-structured
- Factually accurate
- Helpful and informative
- Easy to understand

Question: ${question}`;

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# Or with yarn
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key | ‚úÖ Yes |

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables are used to protect your API key
- **Client-side Limitation**: API key is exposed in the client build (consider using a backend proxy for production)
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of Gemini API rate limits and quotas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please set your Gemini API key" Error**
   - Check that your `.env` file contains the correct API key
   - Ensure the key starts with `VITE_` prefix
   - Restart the development server after adding the key

2. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify your API key is valid and active
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded API quotas

3. **Build Issues**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
   - Update dependencies: `npm update`
